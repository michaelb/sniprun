## Python3 jupyter

Unless you really really need this (for Ipython), I would strongly
advise for the Python3_fifo interpreter which has way less potential issues

### Dependencies

- jupyter

(more specifically, you must be able to run `jupyter-kernel` and
`jupyter-console` from the command line)

### Notes

(As there is a different interpreter for Python, you may want to
force the selection of Python3_jupyter with:)

```lua
require'sniprun'.setup({
    selected_interpreters={'Python3_jupyter'}
})
```

### Limitations

The code runs on a separate jupyter python3 kernel which will NOT interefere
with your own running kernels.

However, mind that the usual limitations of such kernels still apply:
max duration of execution, etc... but you probably don't have to pay
too much attention to this.

The jupyter kernel also has a substantial overhead when it comes to running
code, in addition to imports*, that means the Python3_jupyter interpreter may
feel a bit slow compared to others, when the REPL functionnaluty relying on it.

\* The Jupyter-based interpreter also doesn't support
Python's "list-import" syntax such as:

```python
from math import (
    sin,
    cos
)
```
